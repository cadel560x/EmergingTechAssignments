    "The Iris flower data set was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.\n",

    "The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula, all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other."
