# Emerging Techonologies Project
## Run
You will need to install Anaconda and Git.

1. **Clone Repo** <br>
Open your terminal/cmd in the folder you wish to download the repository and execute the following <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> git clone https://github.com/cadel560x/EmergingTechAssignments.git```

2. **Run Notebook** <br>
Open your terminal/cmd in the project folder <br>
If you wish to run one of the notebook projects, once you have installed jupyter execute the following <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> jupyter notebook```

3. **Run Python Script** <br>
Open your terminal/cmd in the project folder <br>
    1. Install libraries
    
        * Install the following linbraries<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn```<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> conda install -c anaconda keras```  
      
    3. Run Script
    
        * Now that everything is set up, you can finally run the script <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> python digitrec.py```
