    "The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by \"re-mixing\" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American (should be US - not American ) Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from USA high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels. \n",
    " \n",
    "MNIST is the de facto \"Hello World\" dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.\n",

    "## Sample Images\n",
    "The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of images in the MNIST database is organized on two of NIST's databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. Special Database 1 consists of digits written by high school students and Special Database 3 consists of digits written by employees of the United States Census Bureau.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MNIST Files\n",
    "There are 4 files: \n",
    "train-images-idx3-ubyte: training set images \n",
    "train-labels-idx1-ubyte: training set labels \n",
    "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte:  test set images \n",
    "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte:  test set labels\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is stored in a very simple file format designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices.\n",
    "All the integers in the files are stored in the Most Sifnificant (MSB) first or high endian format used by most non-Intel processors. Users of Intel processors and other low-endian machines must flip the bytes of the header. \n",
    " \n",
    "The training set contains 60000 examples, and the test set 10000 examples. \n",
    "The first 5000 examples of the test set are taken from the original NIST training set. The last 5000 are taken from the original NIST test set. The first 5000 are cleaner and easier than the last 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The IDX File Format\n",
    "The IDX file format is a simple format for vectors and multidimensional matrices of various numerical types. \n",
    "The basic format is: \n",
    "magic number (usually a four-byte integer)  \n",
    "size in dimension 0  \n",
    "size in dimension 1  \n",
    "size in dimension 2  \n",
    ".....  \n",
    "size in dimension N  \n",
    "data  \n",
    "data  \n",
    "data  \n",
    ".....  \n",
    "\n",
    "The magic number is usually a four-byte integer (MSB first). The first 2 bytes of it are always 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third byte codes the type of the data:  \n",
    "0x08: unsigned byte  \n",
    "0x09: signed byte  \n",
    "0x0B: short (2 bytes)  \n",
    "0x0C: int (4 bytes)  \n",
    "0x0D: float (4 bytes)  \n",
    "0x0E: double (8 bytes)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The 4-th byte codes the number of dimensions of the vector/matrix: 1 for vectors, 2 for matrices.... \n",
    "The sizes in each dimension are 4-byte integers (MSB first, high endian, like in most non-Intel processors). \n",
    "The data is stored like in a C array, i.e. the index in the last dimension changes the fastest.\n",
